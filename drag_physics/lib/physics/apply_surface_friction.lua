-- yet more heuristics...
-- there previously was a "stuck entity" problem,
-- where entities took a REAAAAAALY long time to fall down against a wall.
-- this is due to a lack of consideration for normal force.
-- to counter this, moving really fast against a wall will push you away from it;
-- this way, gravity along a flat plane still counters it,
-- but eventually the entity will move away from a vertical wall.
-- the exception is in tight spaces barely big enough for an entity;
-- in that case the entity will slowly slide down as before.
